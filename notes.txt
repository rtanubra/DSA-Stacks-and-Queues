Key Terms
    Stack
    LIFO
    Queue
    FIFO
    Enqueue
    Dequeue

STACK: think undo operations and redo.
    -similar to list access restricted to 1 end.
    -Last in First out.
    -thought of vertical data structure
    -Top of stack is the first and only accessible item
    -implementation is Singly linked list with further constraints on how you can add or takeaway.
        -push(data)
            -would aim to add data to stack.
        -pop()
            -take away the item. return that node and then also change the top.

QUEUE
    -data structure that First in First out.
    -lines are real life examples of queue hence name.
    -development practice is a event loop of web browser
        -first you do something then you do another. 
    -Implementation : singly linked list with further constraints.
        -enqueue(data): adds data to a queue (insertion)
            -change the last item.
        -dequeue():removes the oldest data added to a queue and point to a new first.

Array Javascript Stack and Queue:
    -push() puts item at the end this would be the same addition exhibited in Stacks and Queue
    -pop() removes the last item this is the same way items are removed in Stack
    -shift() removes first item this is the dequeue process.
